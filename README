NAME
    Test::RedisServer - redis-server runner for tests.

SYNOPSIS
        use Redis;
        use Test::RedisServer;
        use Test::More;
    
        my $redis_server;
        eval {
            $redis_server = Test::RedisServer->new;
        } or plan skip_all => 'redis-server is required to this test';
    
        my $redis = Redis->new( $redis_server->connect_info );
    
        is $redis->ping, 'PONG', 'ping pong ok';
    
        done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
METHODS
  new(%options)
        my $redis_server = Test::RedisServer->new(%options);

    Create a new redis-server instance, and start it by default (auto_start
    option avoid this)

    Available options are:

    *   auto_start => 0 | 1 (Default: 1)

        Automatically start redis-server instance (by default). You can
        disable this feature by "<auto_start =" 0>>, and start instance
        manually by "start" method below.

    *   conf => 'HashRef'

        This is redis.conf key value pair. Any key-value pair supported that
        redis-server supports.

        If you want to use this redis.conf:

            port 9999
            databases 16
            save 900 1

        Your conf parameter will be:

            Test::RedisServer->new( conf => {
                port      => 9999,
                databases => 16,
                save      => '900 1',
            });

    *   timeout => 'Int'

        Timeout seconds detecting redis-server is awake or not. (Default: 3)

  start
    Start redis-server instance manually.

  stop
    Stop redis-server instance.

    This method automatically called when object was DESTROY.

  connect_info
    Return connection info for client library to connect this redis-server
    instance.

    This parameter is designed to pass directly to Redis module.

        my $redis_server = Test::RedisServer->new;
        my $redis = Redis->new( $redis_server->connect_info );

  wait_exit
    Block until redis instance exited. This method is useful to use this
    module with Proclet or something daemon management modules.

SEE ALSO
    Test::mysqld for mysqld.

    Test::Memcached for Memcached.

    This module steals lots of stuffs from above modules.

    Test::Mock::Redis, another approach for testing redis application.
